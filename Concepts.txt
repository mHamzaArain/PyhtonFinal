Remember:

1. import :
            When we're importing file in other file we don't name working file
            with importing package brcause python start searching itself then 
            go further to check.
            e.g; pandas.py
                import pandas 

            This through error there is no module name as 'pandas'
            as it search from itself

2. if __name__ == "__main__":
            Working file isn't a main file when we import file that contain functions
            that file is a main file. Although it is beneficial for us when we 
            import main file, that main file won't execute instead of file that imported 
            functions from main file that will execute only.
            
            Note: To execute main file directly, we run main file.   

3. 'is' Vs. '==':
            is      -> Reference  eqaulity     -> 2 Objects refer to the same Object.
            ==   -> Value equality              ->2 Objects have same value
            e.g;
                a = [1,3, 2]    
                b = [1,3, 2]

                > a==b -> T (same values)
                > a is b -> F (because of diff. Reference)

4. Recursive Vs. Iterative:
            Iterative -> Program execute & can't go back finite times.
            e.g;
                def fun():
                    return None

            Recursive -> Program execute & can go back infinite times.
            e.g;
                def fun():
                    return fun()

5. Iterable Vs. Iterator
            Iterable - __iter__() or __getitem__() -> can be loop
            Iterator - __next__() -> it make itrable to make item ready for 
                                                for loop

                def gen(n):
                    for i in range(n):
                        yield i         # generate i

                g = gen(3)
                print(g.__next__())  # 0

6. print, return & yield
            print      -> Print on console
            reutn     -> Return task after compleion
            yield      -> Generate item at run which can't be retrive
